				<p class="portfolio-entry__copy">
					This was a site experience built to promote the show Pure on the WGN network. It's a personality quiz but
					it's
					a
					bit more open-ended. Instead of just answering questions, you'll find words that appeal most to you in a
					word
					search or choose a color that best suits you. At the end, you can see whether you align with a just person
					like
					Noah or someone more ruthless like Voss.
					<br><br>
					This was a fun project to build since there were many different components to build such as the word search
					and
					the color slider. It was also a good challenge to have a similarly smooth experience on mobile.

				<h3 class="portfolio-entry__subtitle">RED Creative Agency</h3>
				<p class="portfolio-entry__copy">
					This is the open-source library I'd maintained throughout my time at 160over90 (formerly known as RED). The
					FF0000
					Ad Tech library (which we affectionately referred to as "FAT") is a frontend framework for building
					lightweight
					but feature-packed ads. It has a custom Webpack process which inlines assets into an FBA payload file to
					reduce
					request overhead as well as canvas animation, a date library, and more.
					<br><br>
					My main contributions were building Webpack plugins and loaders to handle framework-specific parsing as well
					as
					traversing the Webpack dependency graph to gather binary files like images and fonts and put them into one
					payload file.
