					(March 2021 - June 2022)
					<br>
					At Fair/Shift, I built the foundation for the filter system, defining a GraphQL schema for the
					filters to render dynamic backend data and allow quick updates from a CMS. I'd also worked on implementing
					location
					detection, using the Geolocation Web API and server-side
					IP geolocation, to filter nearby cars by distance from a user. In addition, I translated Figma
					designs into actionable Jira tickets and assisted other
					engineers with implementing new features

					(Winter 2020)

					This is a game I made based on the Atari game Tempest called Williwaw. It's not quite the same
					as the original but I had fun making it. It was made for desktop first but can be played on
					mobile

					Built with TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas

					(2018-2020)<br>
					This is the open-source library I'd maintained throughout my time at 160over90 (formerly known as RED). The
					FF0000
					Ad Tech library (affectionately called "FAT") is a framework for building
					lightweight
					and feature-packed ads.
					My main contributions were building Webpack plugins and loaders to handle framework-specific parsing as well
					as
					traversing the Webpack dependency graph to gather binary files like images and fonts and put them into one
					payload file to reduce network overhead
