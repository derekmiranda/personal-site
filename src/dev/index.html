					This is a game I made based on the Atari game Tempest called Williwaw. It's not quite the same
					as the original but I had fun making it. It was made for desktop first but can be played on
					mobile
					<br><br>
					Built with TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas

					Here's an ongoing project where I take in a video stream and apply different effects like offsetting the RGB

					I'd always been interested in generative art so I'd been learning GLSL to write fragment shaders. I wanted to

					(2018-2020)<br>
					This is the open-source library I'd maintained throughout my time at 160over90 (formerly known as RED). The
					FF0000
					Ad Tech library (affectionately called "FAT") is a framework for building
					lightweight
					and feature-packed ads.
					My main contributions were building Webpack plugins and loaders to handle framework-specific parsing as well
					as
					traversing the Webpack dependency graph to gather binary files like images and fonts and put them into one
					payload file to reduce network overhead
