				<h3 class="portfolio-entry__subtitle">Fair â†’ Shift</h3>
				<p class="portfolio-entry__copy">
					I had spent much of my time at Fair, now acquired by Shift, working on the marketplace. It was
					exciting for me to work on the marketplace and apply e-commerce UX principles to Fair's existing
					marketplace page
					<br><br>
					I had built the foundation for the filter system, defining a data schema for the
					filters with
					the backend team
					as well as ingesting and rendering filter data from the backend to avoid requiring a frontend dev for an
					update. I'd also worked on implementing location detection, using the Geolocation Web API as well as
					IP geolocation, to filter nearby cars by distance from a user. Besides development, I helped translate Figma
					designs into actionable Jira tickets and assisted other
					engineers on my teams with implementing any new features on the page

				<h3 class="portfolio-entry__subtitle">160over90</h3>
				<p class="portfolio-entry__copy">
					This was a site experience built to promote the show Pure on the WGN network. It's a personality quiz but it's
					a bit more open-ended. Instead of just answering questions, you'll find words that appeal most to you in a
					word search or choose a color that best suits you. At the end, you can see whether you align with a just
					person like Noah or someone more ruthless like Voss.
					<br><br>
					This was a fun project to build since there were many different components to build such as the word search
					and the color slider. It was also a good challenge to have a similarly smooth experience on mobile.

					This is a game I made based on the Atari game Tempest called Williwaw. It's not quite the same

					I'd always been interested in generative art so I'd been learning GLSL to write fragment shaders. I wanted to
					explore how shapes and colors react to different elements like time and randomness.

				<h3 class="portfolio-entry__subtitle">RED Creative Agency</h3>
				<p class="portfolio-entry__copy">
					This is the open-source library I'd maintained throughout my time at 160over90 (formerly known as RED). The
					FF0000
					Ad Tech library (which we affectionately referred to as "FAT") is a frontend framework for building
					lightweight
					but feature-packed ads. It has a custom Webpack process which inlines assets into an FBA payload file to
					reduce
					request overhead as well as canvas animation, a date library, and more.
					<br><br>
					My main contributions were building Webpack plugins and loaders to handle framework-specific parsing as well
					as
					traversing the Webpack dependency graph to gather binary files like images and fonts and put them into one
					payload file.
